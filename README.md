### Introduction
Fire in the forest can occur naturally or by humans. Naturally, fire takes place due to extreme drought, hot weather, lightning or combustion of dry leaves and scobs. Human activities like throwing cigarettes, especially in forest areas or using borne fire also lead to fires. 
  + So, fires which take place due to humans, are identified earlier than naturally occurring fires. There are various factors involved when a region catches fire. The hot and dry weather works as catalysts for fire. Since when there is fire in any region then the temperature of the region will become high due to fire. So increase in temperature is one of the factors which can help in fire detection events. 
  + But we cannot just depend on temperature to detect fire as the temperature of a region also may increase due to sunlight. So we can also check the concentration of CO, CO2 gases in that region to detect the fire. But CO, CO2 gases can also be generated when someone uses the cigarette in that region so it may give false alarm, i.e., false fire event detection. 
  + To increase the accuracy in predicting fire events, we will use various ML algorithms to check if there is fire or not. We will also train the machine and test by providing custom input whether there is fire or not. We will also calculate the accuracy, recall, and precision of these ML Algorithms. Hence we can save our environment ,animals and livelihood from the adverse results of forest fires.
